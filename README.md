**ChangeIP**
**ChangeIP.com updater**
This is a command line script (bash) to check your ip vs the dynamic ip of a host from changeip.com
This tool does not compare ip change based on stored in a temporary file like most other
similar tools do. 
 

It uses GOOKO's free api service to compare ip address vs dynamic host name

Call to api can be done with [https://gooko.online/ip/dyn?h=YourDynamicHostName.com](https://gooko.online/ip/dyn?h=YourDynamicHostName.com)
